# A simple bot in Discord.js

## Why?

This bot was created as a personal project with multiple motivations. Primarily, it was an opportunity to learn and explore the capabilities of Discord.js, a powerful library for interacting with Discord's API. It as a practical, hands-on way to delve deeper into the world of Discord bot development and understand the intricacies involved..

Lastly, the bot integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3 API, which was another exciting aspect to explore. GPT-3, being a state-of-the-art language model, offers a wide range of possibilities, and incorporating it into the bot provided a unique opportunity to experiment with this technology.
